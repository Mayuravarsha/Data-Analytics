# Data-Analytics Project for 5th Sem CSE in PES University
We have built multiple models to predict the likeliness of a used car getting sold based on its various attributes. We followed the standard procedure of cleaning and preprocessing the data before proceeding with model testing. 
We have used correlation coefficient and root mean square error as the defining basis of which models have performed the best and the worst with the test data.
StratifiedKFold from sklearn module has been used to index the training and testing data.
